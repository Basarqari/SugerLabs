# SugerLabs
My Experience in this year of Google Code-in was the Best.As I learned many new things and what really people think of OpenSource.And I was much appreciated by my friends for joining this as they were also participating in it.To be Frank,I never meta big Online Platform likr Google Code in-2015.But one thing I will say that there is not much exposure of this Competition as less people are aware of it.I suggest you that there should be some online advertising(AdWords,others).But nevertheless I enjoyed the whole Competition.
